Windows host through SSH bastion on Ansible

Found some interesting reading and tested it.

IT IS WORKING !!!! :-)  at least with win_ping

Nice Work!

Here you can find some more details:
http://www.bloggingforlogging.com/2018/10/14/windows-host-through-ssh-bastion-on-ansible/
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-project/hqVIXJvc6tw


psrp - Run tasks over Microsoft PowerShell Remoting Protocol
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/plugins/connection/psrp.html


My configuration:
    
 Inventory variables:   
    
#PSPR variables
ansible_user=Administrator
ansible_password=jVMijRwLbI02gFCo2xkjlZ9lxEA7bm7zgg==
ansible_connection=psrp
ansible_psrp_auth=basic
ansible_psrp_cert_validation=ignore
ansible_psrp_proxy=socks5h://localhost:2222

You need persistent SSH connection between your ansible control host and bastion:

ssh -D 2222 myuser-redhat.com@bastionhost



Funny Windows Module :-)

win_say - Text to speech module for Windows to speak messages and optionally play sounds
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/win_say_module.html#win-say-module

Module 04 - OpenStack

New Repo to short circuit the first part of creating the OpenStack lab:
https://github.com/prakhar1985/osp-ansible-lab
yum install python-openstacksdk git

Useful OpenStack Cheat Sheet if you want to explore your cluster (or don't beleive your machines are running)
https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/user-guide/cli-cheat-sheet.html
HINT: If your labs take 2 days to complete check the VMs (what you created) haven't gone to sleep!
Great blog article about the lab written by a course studentstudent re OpenStack Lab
http://naleejang.tistory.com/207
Best book for Cloud: 
Ansible Cloud Automation Cookbook
Book on OpenStack Ansible Automation by Walter Bentley 
(Head of the North American Ansible Practice

-  pip install --upgrade setuptools
- yum install python-openstacksdk git
- pip install shade --ignore-installe


Looking at openstack

source ~/keystonerc_admin
osp-example(keystone_admin)]# openstack server list



Outputting your in-memory inventory!

1) Create this task AFTER add_host

   - name: Generate lab static inventory file
        template:
          src: lab_inventory.j2
          dest: "my_inventory"

2) Use this for lab_inventory.j2

{% for item in groups %}

[{{item}}]
{%   for entry in groups[item] | sort  %}
{{ entry }} ansible_host={{ hostvars[entry].ansible_ssh_host }}
{%   endfor %}
{% endfor %}



Sample cat /etc/openstack//clouds.yaml

clouds:
  ospcloud:
    auth:
      auth_url: http://192.168.0.20:5000/
      password: r3dh4t1!
      project_name: admin
      username: admin
    identity_api_version: '3.0'
    region_name: RegionOne
ansible:
  use_hostnames: True
  expand_hostvars: False
  fail_on_errors: True



Module 05 - Tower



Ansible Examples

Nasty YAML syntax examples:

https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples

especially: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples/tree/master/lamp_simple_rhel7

In case you want to be like Tony: https://internal-redhat.icims.com/jobs/65866/enablement-senior-solutions-architect/job


Setting up Ansible.cfg to use an ssh.cfg for JumpHosts

1) Ansible.cfg file:

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args =              -F ./ssh.cfg

2) ssh.cfg file:


Match User ec2-user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/68e7key.pem

Match User ankay-redhat.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host bastion
  Hostname bastion.68e7.example.opentlc.com
  User ankay-redhat.com
  ForwardAgent yes
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath /tmp/%h-%r
  
  ControlPersist 5m

Host *.internal *.opentlc.com
  ProxyJump bastion
  User ec2-user

Host *
  StrictHostKeyChecking no

    Ansible, the missing piece. Presentation at Zabbix Conference 2017

Ansible Tower Instalation notes

When you get failure during Tower instalation indicating ansible cannot do sudo on remote nodes start your installation with below

ANSIBLE_SUDO=True ./setup.sh


@Tony
looks like "LDAP Organization and Team Mapping" doesn't work as described in lab and/or docs in 3.3.  Users from AD do not get mapping to proper Team.



Import an inventory file to tower: (btw, it's too dirty)
tower-manage inventory_import --source ./myhosts --inventory-id 5 --overwrite

Getting the size of an array in Jinja2: "{{ my_array | length }}



ansible.cfg:
    
 [defaults]
inventory=./osp_jumpbox_inventory
timeout=180

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args=" -F ./ssh.cfg -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=180s"
host_key_checking=False


Sample ssh.cfg

Host workstation
  Hostname workstation-cd71.rhpds.opentlc.com
  User cloud-user

Host 10.10.10.*
  User cloud-user
  ProxyJump workstation

Match User cloud-user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/openstack.pem

Host *
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath /tmp/%h-%r
  ControlPersist 5m
  PasswordAuthentication no
  ForwardAgent yes
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null



Print out an in-memory inventory: 
    
    roles/osp-facts/templates/lab_inventory.j2


{%  for item in groups | sort if item != "jumpbox" %}

[{{item}}]
{%   for entry in groups[item] | sort if entry != "workstation" %}
{{ entry }}
{%   endfor %}
{% endfor %}


New roles/osp-facts/tasks/main.yml

- name: Fetch Instance Info
    os_server_facts:
      cloud: ospcloud
      region_name: RegionOne
    register: result

  - name: Add host
    add_host:
      name: "{{ item.public_v4 }}"
     group:
        - "{{ item.metadata.group }}"
        - "{{ item.metadata.deploExportyment_name }}"
    loop: "{{result.ansible_facts.openstack_servers}}"

  - name: Add host
    add_host:
      name: "{{ item.public_v4 }}"
    loop: "{{result.ansible_facts.openstack_servers}}"

  - name: Generate lab static inventory file
    template:
      src: lab_inventory.j2
      dest: "/tmp/my_inventory"
    delegate_to: localhost

  - name: print hosts
    debug:
      msg:
        - " name: {{ item.public_v4 }}"
        - "group: {{ item.metadata.group }}"
    loop: "{{result.ansible_facts.openstack_servers}}"

tower filter for AWS instances
tag:instance_filter=three-tier-app-ankay*

theres not the app group , only tag_AnsibleGroup_apps
AWS tags should be mapped against ansible group

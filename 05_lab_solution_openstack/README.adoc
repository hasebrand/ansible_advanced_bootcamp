== README OpenStack Lab

=== Overview

Spins up a 3 tier lab environment on OpenStack and then plays three-tier app against it.

Current directory setup (July 2018)
- 1_OpenStack, the 1st stage i.e. bring up OpenStack Infrastrucure
- 2_OpenStack, create an In-memory Inventory and run "Good Ansible"
- OSP_Master, WIP, combine the above 2 stages
- ec2.demo, demo a dynamic inventory using sc2.py and ec2.ini

TODO/Wish list
* Tidy Prakhar's OpenStack Playbooks and roles
** Make sure name: used everywhere
** Make sure name: meaningful
** Tody up white spacing etc
** Rename OSP Facts role (in-memory inventory), misleading?
** Collapse the 2 add_host tasks into 1?
** Create a junja2 template to "print out" the inventory
* Create a playbook/role to do initial setup

Note: Entire lab can be run from laptop

=== Running the Lab

4 main stages

=== Workstation Preperation

* Initial setup on workstation-GUID
** Setup workstation
*** setup the repos
*** install utilities and packages
*** install shade (OpenStack Python Library)
*** download and setup ssh key for cloud-user (IMPORTANT)!
*** create clouds.yml and verify openstack hypervisors are running
*** download RHEL image into openstack
*** verify openstack is working

=== Laptop Preperation
* Download key and set permissions
* Download / create the OpenStack Playbooks
* Create the flavor
* Run `ansible-playbook site.yml`

=== Create the OpenStack VMs

(my Step-1 Playbooks)

Verify they exist/work: `ssh -F ssh.cfg 10.10.10.4`

=== Create 3-Tier App

_Original source: git clone https://github.com/prakhar1985/good-ansible.git
** just needs inventory and ssh.cfg updated with guid
